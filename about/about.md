I make on the murky edge between story (as in text) and story *again* (but art, this time). My practice combs together small games, interactive art, animation, short fiction, digital painting and comics. Practising in so many fields means that the resulting work is almost always transmedia, which reveals pockets of knowledge to be filled: what lies between a game and a short story? A poster and a book? An animated gif and a short film? What kind of story does my **act of making** tell in itself?


I am an artist who learns by making. I digest new knowledge by turning it into a sketchbook of thumbnails. I contemplate the ethics of my position as a practitioner and researcher by writing a comic about it. Like this, my practice and my quest for knowledge are, really, impossible to separate: every painting carries in it something I learned, and every piece of new knowledge I absorb or generate is reflected somewhere, sometime in an act of practice, big or small.
